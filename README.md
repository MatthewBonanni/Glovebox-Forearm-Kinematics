# Glovebox-Forearm-Kinematics
This software models and optimizes the accessible volume, or "gamut", of robotic arms when constrained by a glovebox.

It was initially developed at Northeastern University as part of a Capstone Design project, which presented the design and implementation of a glovebox-optimized robotic forearm compatible with NASA's Valkyrie R5 robot. This research was supported by [NU's RIVeR Laboratory](http://www.robot.neu.edu "RIVeR Laboratory Homepage").
