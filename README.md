# Glovebox-Forearm-Kinematics
This software models and optimizes the accessible volume ("gamut") of arbitrary kinematic chains when constrained by a glovebox.

This software models and optimizes the gamut (range of motion) of various robotic arms.
It computes optimal geometric parameters for use in the team's effort to design glovebox-optimized forearms for NASA's Valkyrie humanoid robot.
